    <h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
    <h3> What is SumpSense? </h3>
    <p> SumpSense is a sensor that continuously monitors the lonely and mostly forgotten sump pump and basin found in the basement of many homes. If SumpSense detects a problem, it alerts you immediately via push notification to your phone. </p>
    <h3> Why would I want SumpSense? </h3>
    <p> SumpSense is all about peace of mind. SumpSense is the most comprehensive solution available to consumers for sump pump monitoring. It includes the revolutionary “Continuous Depth Measurement” feature; a combination of hardware and software innovation
      that tracks abnormalities in water depth. </p>
    <h3> Is it possible that my basement will flood even if I have a SumpSense? </h3>
    <p> Yes. While SumpSense will notify you immediately and hopefully allow you to take preventative action, it is only a sensor. It does not control your pump in any way. SumpSense is an important component of a complete basement water mitigation solution
      designed by a qualified contractor. </p>
    <h3> How do I set it up? </h3>
    <p> The SumpSense is simple to install, you don’t need to hire a professional. The unit comes with detailed installation instructions and our support team is available to answer any questions or problems that arise while installing the unit. </p>
    <p>In order to install the SumpSense, you place the “anchor” in your sump pit. Next, you plug the SumpSense unit into the outlet that your sump pump is already plugged in to. You then plug your sump pump directly into the SumpSense unit. </p>
    <p> Once the SumpSense unit is installed, you connect to it via Wi-Fi using SumpSense’s simple iOS application. Once it is connected, you don’t have to interact with the unit itself -- it will simply monitor your sump pump and notify you by push notification
      if it detects a problem.</p>
    </p>
    <h3> How does the sensor work? </h3>
    <p> The SumpSense sensor uses air pressure to monitor the your sump pit. As the water in the sump pit increases and decreases the air pressure in the tube connecting the anchor to the SumpSense unit changes. </p>
    <h3> What will SumpSense notify me about? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> High water, pump running</li>
      <li>High water, pump not running </li>
      <li>Pump running, water at low</li>
      <li> Pump running, water above low but running longer than average. This most likely indicates a failing pump but could also mean water is entering faster than normal. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> How will SumpSense notify me if it detects a potential issue? </h3>
    <p> During the beta program, SumpSense will notify you via push notifications to your phone. Future releases will allow for the option of email and SMS notifications.
    </p>
    <h3> What if my Wifi or my power goes out? </h3>
    <p> We will alert you right away. </p>
    <h3>Do you support Android?  </h3>
    <p> For the beta release, SumpSense only supports iOS. Future releases will include Android support. </p>
    <h3> How much does a SumpSense cost? </h3>
    <p>Beta testers will receive a SumpSense unit free of charge. </p>
    <h3> Will I ever have to replace it? </h3>
    <p>No! The SumpSense is meant to be installed permanently. </p>
    <h3> Why is SumpSense better than other options for sump pump monitoring? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Very simple design with few moving parts</li>
      <li> Easy to set up </li>
      <li> Continuous water depth readings; you’re always in the know</li>
      <li> No need to constantly check an app; we notify you if you need to know anything and leave you alone otherwise.</li>
      <li> Sophisticated predictive monitoring. We track what's normal for your sump pump and use machine learning to tailor when there's an issue.</li>
  </ul>
